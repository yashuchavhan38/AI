# Genetic Algorithm Optimization in TensorFlow
## Description

Implemente Genetic Algorithm with Tensorflow to find out the maximum value of the function *f(x)=x+10sin(5x)+7cos(4x)* in the range [0, 9].

While TensorFlow isn't really the best for GA's, this example shows that we can implement different procedural algorithms with TensorFlow operations.
